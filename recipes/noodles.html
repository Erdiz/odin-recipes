    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes after work you're tired and don't have the energy to prepare a whole meal and 
        clean up multiple pots and pans after but you still need an energy boost with some quick
        protein. This spicy peanut noodle recipe is eay to make, only requires 7 ingredients, and
        only requires a small pot to make. Optionally you can also add some more protein like 
        chicken or beef but it isn't required if you're not feeling like it.

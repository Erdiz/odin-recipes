    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Cut of Choice(we recommend ribeye for this recipe)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 Sprigs of Fresh Rosemary</li>
            <li>3 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a pan to medium-high.</li>
            <li>While the pan is preheating rub down your steak with your seasoning of choice but
            we recommend only using some salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is done preheating add a little bit of oil and then place your 
            steak in the pan.</li>
            <li>Let a sear develop before flipping.</li>
            <il>Repeat this step until the outside of your steak is brown, excluding the fat cap.</il>
            <li>Take your pan and place it in an oven preheated to 400 degrees farenheit.</li>
            <il>After 10-12 minutes remove the steak from the oven and then from the pan.</il>
            <il>Put the pan on high heat again and then place the steak back in the pan along 
            with your butter, rosemary, and garlic cloves.</il>
            <il>Once the butter is melted begin basteing the steak by tilting the pan to one side
            and using a spoon to take the melted butter and pour it over the steak.
            </il>
            <il>Continue for 1-2 minutes and then remove the steak from the pan and allow to rest
            for 10 minutes before cutting up and serving.</il>
        </ol>
